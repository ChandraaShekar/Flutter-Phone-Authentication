# Flutter Phone Auth Using Firebase

This project focuses on how to implement **Phone Authentication** 

This project is inspired from the project by Rajayogan at [https://github.com/rajayogan/flutter-phoneAuth](https://github.com/rajayogan/flutter-phoneAuth)

I hope this project will help you implement Phone Authentication in your application.

If you are facing AndroidX issues like me, then try migrating your application to AndroidX with the help of this [Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/androidx-compatibility)

More Updates for this project are yet to come.

Enjoy CodingðŸ¤Ÿ
